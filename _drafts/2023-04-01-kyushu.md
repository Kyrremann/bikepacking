In the spring of 2023 I travelled back to Japan to bike my first bikepacking trip outside of Norway, and my first long bike trip!
I've never cycled for more than three days straight, so my two week plan was quite a step up!
Originally I had planned to cycle in Hokkaido, but while researching bikepacking routes I discovered that it would be quite cold cycling so far north.
Going further south sounded like a good idea, and Kyūshū looked really promising.

So with Kyūshū as my area I started searching for routes and looking at maps.
I quickly found out that Cape Sata is a good starting point, as it's the southern most point of the main Japanese islands.
So starting from there I quickly mapped out a route going north all the way up to Kitakyushu.
While mapping the first version of the route I found interesting points on the way, and learned about Yakushima.
Yakushima looked like a beautiful island for cycling and hiking!
Factoring a couple of days for Yakushima, and that cycling the last bit till Kitakyushu, Beppu seemed like a better goal for my trip.

TODO: Write more about how my trip ended the way it did

## Verdict (TL;DR)

## The route

[The original route (on RideWithGPS)](https://ridewithgps.com/collections/1990719?privacy_code=sjGdcBtTYmzWqgGD)

I used RideWithGPS.com to plan my whole route.
Instead of making the perfect route from the beginning I made several different routes.
Starting big, and then narrowing it down for a more realistic route.
The original plan was to bike around Yakushima, and all the way from Cape Sata to Beppu, but as you can see, I skipped Yakushima and skipped some parts on the way.



## Transportation

My original plan was to fly down and take the Shinkansen back to Tokyo, but bringing big luggage on the Shinkansen looked like to much hassle.
It was also cheaper to book a flight early, and a lot easier with luggage.
So in the ended I flew down to Kagoshima, and returned from Oita airport.

## Challenges

My biggest challenge, or hurdle for the trip was finding vegetarian food in the more remote areas of my trip.
The convenience stores always have a selection, from egg sandwich (tamago sando), bao buns, to onigiri.
Usually I ended up looking for Indian or western food like pizza.
Asking for vegetarian in a local Japanese restaurant often didn't lead to any success.
Breakfast at hotels was usually easier, as they had buffet where I usually could grab vegetables without the meat.
Plus there where always miso soup, and bread and jam.

The challenge with vegetarian dinner also made tenting a little bit harder, as I didn't bring my camping stove to make my own food.
So I was dependent on either eating before tenting, or be able to cycle to a restaurant after pitching my tent.

Other challenges on my trip is remembering that a lot of restaurants are closed in the middle of the day, so if I wanted a better lunch I needed to have that planned.
Also a lot of places to visit closes around five (17:00), so I usually needed to visit them before I arrive at my place to stay for the night.

My last type of hurdle on the trip, which was mainly me not reading a sign, or ignoring a closed road, as some roads where taken by landslide, typhoon, or earthquake.
Twice, on the same day, I experienced that the road or a bridge was destroyed.
I could have avoided the last one, if I had translated a sign instead of gambling that it wasn't anything important, as only have of the road was closed.
Which led me to first cruise down 3km, and then cycling up again, in the rain.

## What I'm happy I did

I'm really glad that I took some days to hike in between all the cycling.
Especially the full day hike in Kuju mountains was really nice.
Kuju mountains was also a really good place to hike.
As you could go for a shorter route up to Kujusan, or decided to hike all the small tops in the vicinity.
If that wasn't enough, you could always choose to hike down to Chojabaru Visitor Center, as I did.

I can also recommend planning for shorter cycling days, so that you have time to get of your bike to explore, and arrive early at you stay for the night.
Also really happy that I visited an onsen nearly every day of my trip!
Arriving tired and cold, either at a campsite or hotel, and then going to visit an onsen afterwards was really nice!
It's also a good way to clean of all the filth from the day.

PS: Remember that public baths/onsen doesn't have free towels, so bring your own (or buy it there).

## Essentials

I'm pretty pleased with my gear for this trip, and I feel like all the shorter trips I've been on before had prepared me for this.
Some of the items around during the trip, when I found it fitted better in a different bag.
I also doubled up on cycle tube (I was riding tubeless), and cycling shorts, both of these I'm pretty sure was unnecessary for my trip.
Of course you don't really know when your going to have a flat, but I didn't have any, so felt that having two tubes was a bit much.
Especially as I always traveled from city to city.
Doubling up on the cycling kit was also a bit much, I just made sure to remember to wash it regularly.
Either wash it in the sink or, if the hotel had a washing room, a quick wash in a machine made it good for the next day.

One thing I was missing was a long sleeved cycling jersey, as it sometimes was too warm with a jacket, but too cold for short sleeves.
My solution was to use on of the long sleeves wool t-shirts underneath my cycling jersey.

I've made a list of my gear at the bottom of this post, sorted on which bag they where in.

## Accommodation

The original plan was to camp every night for my two week trip.
I managed two days before I ended up in my first of many hotels.
The main reason (as mentioned in challenges) is that it was easier to find food near hotels in the cities, instead of the camping sites that was a bit outside the cities.
Other reasons was the price for campsite compared to hotels, and the ease of staying at a hotel, instead of staying hunkered inside my tent for a whole evening.

Except for one free campsite, both my campsite was ¥4000, and even thought the hotels was mostly double that, I felt staying at a hotel was a better experience and value for money.
Even better was the night I stayed at the [Aso Base hostel](http://www.aso-backpackers.com/), which was ¥2800 for one night in a shared room.
Can really recommend that place, and I bet that hostels in more smaller city will be as cozy.

### What would I change for my next trip

When planning the trip I should find a way to take into account that some days I will be tired, or that it will rain too much (for me).
In short, I need to plan for some buffer days.
On this trip I had one whole day at a hotel early on because of rain, but it was also good since I was tired.
I also arrived two days earlier than planned to my destination, meaning I kinda had three buffer days.
Three days is a bit too much, I think it will work with two days, and also plan for some easier days.
Most of my short days had either long day of hiking, or a steep hill to climb.

Arriving two days earlier in Beppu meant that I had to "sit" and wait for my flight back to Tokyo.
Not sure if booking the flight in advance was the best use of my time.
That may just be me being restful.
As I did get to see and experience Beppu!
The main problem was probably that it was too expensive to stay on the hotel I had booked in advance, so I had to change hotel.
Not sure what I will do here for my next trip.

What I am pretty sure I'll skip on my next trip is camping.
Camping in Kyūshū in April wasn't as warm as I had predicted.
Mostly when I've been bikepacking in Norway I end up biking the whole day, so when the tent is pitched I could just go to sleep.
On this trip I was often at the camp site around five or six, still plenty of time for some local sightseeing or reading my book.
When the weather is nearing 10 and below, it's not that nice to sit outside to read, meaning I ended up hunkered in my sleeping bag.
I'm doing that to much on my local trips that I want to do that on this types of trips.
Maybe If I had traveled later in the season this wouldn't had been a trouble at all.
My night south of Mount Aso was really cold, I had to put on all my clothes during the night to not freeze!
Next trip I'm probably going to plan it with hotel stays in mind.
I'm also going to save a bit on weight too skipping camping equipment.

I also need to remember that luggage storage may close before I land my plane, so always double check.
This time I ended up bringing my bike to my hotel in Tokyo, and then having to travel back to the airport to get it stored the day after.

## My trip

### Dag 1, 63km, 1300m - Kagoshima til Ibusuki 

Søndag 2. april startet turen min fra Kagoshima, sør i Kyūshū.
Målet for turen var å sykle fra Cape Sata i sør, til Beppu i nord.
Jeg syklet Ibusuki Skyline, som er en bilvei som følger en fjellrygg sørover.
Herfra fikk man flott utsikt over Kagoshima Bay og vulkanen Sakurajima (bildet til høyre).

### Dag 2, 65km, 780m

Fra campingplassen hadde jeg god utsikt til vulkanen Kaimondake (til høyre).
Dagens mål var å ta ferje over Kagoshima Bay og sykle ned til Cape Sata, startpunktet for turen.
Det var også mye ørn nede ved kysten, en landet 5 meter unna meg mens jeg syklet!

Jeg fikk også prøvd meg på å bli begravd i varm sand, og badet i onsen. 

### Dag 3, 90km, 1500m - På vei nordover

I dag startet endelig turen nordover fra Cape Sata. Fra Cape Sata er det 2600km til det nordligste punktet i Japan.
Det var mye østavind denne dagen, men heldigvis gikk ruta hovedsakelig vest for fjellene.
Jeg skulle også campe denne natta, men campingen var på litt langt unna restauranter, og på toppen av et berg.
Derfor ble det hotell med onsen! Jeg syklet også innom en foss, men bommet på veien og endte opp på toppen, så fikk bare sett ned på den.
Skulle visst ha syklet nede i dalen, og ikke opp på toppen.

### Dag 4, 87km, 1700m - Over fjellet

Det ble en lang og tung dag, og var også den eneste dagen jeg syklet i regnet.
Ruta gikk over Mt. Onogara, fremfor å sykle rundt.
Jeg var spent på selve turen da jeg var usikker på hvor bra grusveien på toppen av fjellet var.
Det viser seg at det var en grunn til at veien var stengt med et gjerde.
En bru og et lengre strekke av veien var tatt av flom.
Så jeg måtte være litt kreativ for å komme over. Heldigvis gikk alt bra.

Fjellet var bare de første 40km, så det var fortsatt nesten 50km igjen, og det hadde begynt å regne.
Så da ble det å tråkke i vei på hovedveien frem til Kirishima.
Det ble hotell de to neste nettene, da det var meldt regn hele neste dag.

En morsom fakta om hotellet, de hadde verdens største rubin satt inn i et kors, som stod i en glasskirke bygd inni hotellet!

### Dag 5, 39km, 1260m - Til Kinkowan

I dag skulle jeg ikke sykle langt, men ingen lett tur for det.
Jeg startet på nesten 0 meter over havet, og skulle opp til 1200 meter!

Var duskregn når jeg startet, og tett tåke når jeg var fremme.
Og med tanke på hvor kaldt det var på 1200 meter ble det hotell i natt også.

På veien opp så jeg hjort, villsvin, og en japansk mår!

### Dag 6, 7km, 500m - Ebino platå

I dag skulle jeg gå på fjelltur for å besøke min første vulkan på turen.
Karakunidake ligger på 1700m og er ikke en aktiv vulkan.
Naboen Shinmoedake derimot hadde siste utbrudd i 2011!
Sør for Karakunidake ligger Onami-ike krateret som er fullt av vann.

Selv med mye vind var turen veldig fin, og jeg skulle gjerne tatt meg mer tid til å se mer av området.
Dessverre hadde jeg en buss å rekke siden jeg hadde bestemt meg for å ikke sykle de to neste fjellpassene, men heller spare litt tid og få bedre vær til Aso og Kuju.
Det ble 20km nedoverbakke på sykkelen til bussen, som tok meg videre til storbyen Kumamoto.

### Dag 7, 82km, 1400m - broer og fjell

Dagens mål var å sykle til foten av Mt. Aso.
På veien ville jeg innom broen Tsūjun, som er en viktig akvedukt bro for å fordele vannet Shiraito platået.
Veien til Aso gikk for det meste på rolige bortgjemte veier, så det var lite trafikk.
Noe som gjordet det til en veldig flott dag.

På veien fant jeg også en amerikansk sandwich restaurant. Det var første gang på en uke jeg hadde en lengre samtale!

Nedenfor kan du se en av mange flotte kumlokk i Japan, det er faktisk over 12 000 unike kumlokk!


### Dag 8, 45km, 1000m - Aso Mountain

Aso Mountain ligger egentlig i et stort krater, men det er heldigvis bare dette fjellet som fortsatt er aktivt.
Det var en fin dag, og jeg fikk en guidet helikoptertur rundt fjellet og krateret!
Det gjorde at jeg fikk sett nedi, og ikke bare fra siden, på avstand! Det var skikkelig gøy!

På veien ned så endte jeg opp på et hostel, og traff folk fra Tyskland, Frankrike, Kina, og Japan. Skikkelig sosialt!

### Dag 9, 56km, 1100m -Til  Kuju

Dagens sykkeltur gikk fra en fjellkjede, til en annen.
Målet var en campingplass hvor jeg skulle sove i en togvogn (glemte helt å ta bilde)!
Jeg var også på sykkelturens høyeste punkt på 1330m!

### Dag 10, 18km, 970m - Fjelltur i Kuju

Dagen startet med tett tåke og lett regn, men det lettet utpå formmidagen!
Målet var Kyūshū høyeste fjell på 1791m! Det ble også en tur til en onsen oppe i fjellene.
På hva som lignet på en DNT-hytte.

### Dag 11, 51km, 570m - Til Beppu

Siste sykkeldag for turen.
Jeg kjente det i kroppen og i psyken at det kom til å bli deilig å være fremme, å kunne slappe av en hel dag uten å tenke på sykling eller hvor jeg skulle videre.
Underveis på turen hadde jeg endret hvor jeg skulle overnatte nesten hver dag, så brukte litt for mye tid på å se etter nye steder å sove.

Turen til Beppu gikk veldig fint, og det var som det har vært igjennom hele turen, mye flott utsikt å oppleve!
Litt mer trafikk i dag, da jeg valgte å følge en turistvei over et fjellpass, men heldigvis flott og bred vei hele veien.

### Fremme i Beppu

Jeg kom frem til Beppu to dager tidligere enn planlagt, som ga meg god tid til å utforske byen.
Jeg startet med en tur til de syv helvetene (Jigoku) i Beppu. Dette er 7 (finnes flere) varme kilder som er for varme til å bade i.

Beppu er onsen hovedstaden i Japan, så det er mange å velge mellom.
En av de mer spesielle er en “gjørme” onsen, hvor man bader i noe som føltes mer ut som sølevann.

Jeg besøkte også et apetempel, hvor de mater aper for å unngå at de stjeler fra de som bor i området rundt.

### Afterthoughts about my gear

I should probably had brought legs instead of knees as part of the cycling kit.
Since if it first was cold, it didn't help that much with just knees.
Arms wasn't that useful either, especially since I had a fleece, rain jacket, or long sleeves to put on when it was cold.

My Northern Playground shirts was really nice to have.
They are good at keeping warmth, but also not getting to hot in the sun.
Should probably had one with a high neck instead of the short neck one.

Having two pairs of gloves was also really nice, one short and one long.
The long pair was also nice for the hikes I went on.
