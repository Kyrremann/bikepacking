In the spring of 2024 I had set off three weeks to cycle in Japan again (see [Kyushu](/japan/2023/kyushu) from 2023).
This time I wanted to join the [Shikoku Circuit Cycling](https://cycling-island-shikoku.com/en) challenge, cycling the whole 1000 km around the island Shikoku!
The challenge sadly costs money to join, but you do get a nice cycling jersey and a stamp book.
Yes, you read that right, a stamp book.
On your way around the island you have to stop at these road stations or 道の駅 (michi no eki) as it's called in Japanese, to get your book stamped.
When you finish the circuit you send in a picture of your stamp, and proof of route, and you receive a diploma and a medal, that turned out to be a belt buckle!

With the route fixed I started to look for interesting stops, and decide if I wanted to go for tents or hotels this time.
The mix I did last year didn't really fit me, so this year I decided to not bring a tent and go for hotels every night.
I also didn't want to waste time every night looking for my next stay, so I ended up booking all of my hotels in advanced.
That worked really well for me, and I only ended up canceling one, because of bad weather.

## Verdict (TL;DR)

Shikoku was a really beautiful island, and I can fully recommend doing the Shikoku Circuit Cycling challenge!
Since I was doing the circuit I was following the coast the whole way around, but there are some really pretty mountains and valleys inland that I would love to visit another time.
If you have read a bit about cycling Shikoku you will always come over people not recommending cycling the north, and I can understand.
The south of Shikoku is really beautiful, fewer cars, and more deserted.
The north is the opposite, where there is nearly 300 km long stretch with cities and houses, plus plenty of cars and trucks.
I'm pretty happy with my road choices in the north as I didn't have any bad experiences with cars or trucks.
Hadn't the circuit gone around the north I would probably headed into the mountains after Imabari and done the [UFO Line](https://shikoku-tourism.com/en/see-and-do/23808).

## The route

[My route (on RideWithGCP)](https://ridewithgps.com/collections/2194643?privacy_code=hlVF2Q0W3ynl0Mr6Mn3UeojoCR1OaA1q)

[The official route (en)](https://cycling-island-shikoku.com/en/route_1000_en.html)

I started of tracing the official route in RideWithGPS to see where it actually went, as the map on [cycling-island-shikoku.com](https://cycling-island-shikoku.com) is not very precise.
It turns out the official route is following the old main road, meaning that there is a lot of tunnels, especially in the south.
With that in mind I started out making my own route trying to follow the official route as close as possible, but avoiding most of the tunnels.
My route ended up at 1171km, which is not that much longer.

Another difference between my route and the official route is that I started in Imabari.
Meaning I had to get back to Matsuyama when I finished the circle, as the ferry to Hiroshima departs from Matsuyama.

## Transportation

As I started with riding the [Shimanami Kaido](shimanami-kaido) there wasn't any transportation for me.
I would highly recommend starting the Shikoku circuit by riding it, it's beautiful!

If you're skipping the Shimanami Kaido I would recommend starting from Matsuyama, as the official route does.
Then train or plane to Hiroshima, and then a ferry is probably the easiest way to get to Matsuyama.

## Accommodation

For this trip I opted for hotels, ryokans, and hostels for each nigth.
Everything was also pre-booked a couple of months in advance.
This also meant that I needed to cycled the distance planned each day, as most of my bookings where non-refundable when my trip started.
The average price for each night was around ¥5000, and I can recommend every place I stayed at!
[Hotel Orange (ホテルオレンジ)](http://hotel-orange.jp/) in Misakiura even included dinner and breakfast!
Most of the bookings where done through Booking.com, but some where through direct e-mails, or the accommodations site.

## What I’m happy I did

I'm really happy with my planning for this trip, as having all the accommodations sorted before hand made every day a little bit easier.
Also having each day planned down to each turn made it easier to enjoy the scenery and look for places I had not spotted before hand.
I'm a true believer that having a fixed course makes it easier to enjoy the ride, as you have the read thread to follow.
Of course if you're not riding on fixed time, you don't really need a red thread, but if your trip is time boxed as mine, planning is gold!

## Challenges

This trip went really smooth, and my biggest hurdle was that I got a cold on day four, that I didn't got rid of before day six.
Luckily I got some Japanese medicine and I had a rest day on day five, so all in all, it wasn't that bad.
I was also really lucky with the weather!
The first rain day was on my first rest day, and I managed to move my second rest day to fit with my second rain day.
The only rain I while cycling was for three hours at the end of the day cycling from Kōchi to Susaki.

I also decided to be more flexitarian on this trip, instead of strictly vegetarian, which made finding dinner a lot more easier.

## What would I change for my next trip

I'm pretty pleased with my planning, and how I spent my days on this trip.
The distance each day fitted the area I was cycling through.
Longer days on the distances where it was less to see, and shorter distances where I wanted to stop a lot.
What I did forget to plan for is hiking Takaya Shrine (高屋神社).
It was marked on my map, but on the same day I also had to ride 75km and visit the beautiful Ritsurin Garden (栗林公園).
The weather wasn't the best for a view from the top, so I'm glad I didn't squeezed it in, but I want to return to experience it!

One thing I regret not bringing with me was my international drivers license.
I've gotten one since I was staying two more weeks after my cycling trip, and was going to rent a car to visit Hakone.
With the drivers license I could have driven to hike [Mount Ishizuchi](石鎚山).
The original plan was to to hike it after I've cycled around, but since they where doing maintenance on the ropeway taking me up to 1300m I skipped it.
It was only for the week I had plan to hike it, so I was really unfortunate with my timing there.

## My trip

### Day 1, 106km, 734m - First day on my trip around Shikoku

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/)
**

The first day on my trip around Shikoku was longer than I remembered, I had to hurry a bit at the end to reach the first stamp at a roadside station (道の駅).
During the first day I visited a towel museum (タオル美術館).
Not sure what I expected it to be about, and not sure what I'm left with afterwards.
It felt very Japanese, and it was a nice area, but as a cycling detour it was a bit of a miss.

The first stamp was a pretty cool feeling, finally my trip has started kind of feeling!
As I arrived just before closing time I didn't have much time to experience the first road station, but looking back it looked like one of the more boring ones with only tourist information.
A lot of the other ones I visited had food and snacks to buy.

Not far from the road station was the Zenigata Sunae (Coined-shape Sand Art) (銭形砂絵(寛永通宝)) which was pretty cool to look at.
The hill up was pretty steep, so a good challenged at the end of the day.
Afterwards I went to a hotel onsen, before I headed over to my hotel further into the city of Kanonji.

For dinner I went to chicken restaurant called Jujuan (じゅじゅ庵（骨付鳥）), where I ended getting talking with the couple sitting next to me at the bar.
They where from the area, and it was fun to chat to the locals.
Also two unusually things happened that night, first was that the waiter wanted a selfie with me, out of the blue, and I also got a CD by [Hiroshi Miyama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshi_Miyama) which is a Japanese enka singer.
Not sure why I got the CD, but the restaurant had a lot of Hiroshi memorabilia!
So for now it's a nice memory of that evening, as I don't have a CD-player to play it on.

### Day 2, 73km, 627m - First (and only) missing stamp

My itinerary had climbing the hundreds of stairs all the way up to Takaya Shrine (高屋神社) as the first stop, but I had forgotten to set of the time needed to do it.
So instead I cycled past it, looking up to what I could do next time I was in the area.

Next stop was my second stamp at a road station a little bit out of my way around the coast.
This road station was a bit up in the mountains, giving me a nice hill to cruise down to the coast again.

The weather was nice, with a little bit of wind changing between headwind and tailwind.
This seemed to a common occurrence cycling around Shikoku.
Maybe a bit more tailwind, if I remember correctly.

At the next road station, which turned out to be closed on Mondays (the only stamp I didn't collect) I met a guy from Hong Kong cycling part of the Shikoku circuit challenge.
On a full-suspension mountain bike!
That's impressive, since it's only asphalt going around Shikoku.
Next to the road station is Play Park Gold Tower (ゴールドタワー), a 158m tall skyscraper with a strange fish exhibit in it.
The view from the top was great, but was strange looking at the view through an aquarium.

As planned, I arrived early in Takamatsu, giving me plenty of time to sight-seeing the wonderful Ritsurin Garden (栗林公園).
My hotel in Takamatsu was the only one that didn't really have a place to store my bike, except for just outside hotel.
For me that felt a little bit too unsafe in a big city, but I had planned for this, and used my rinko bag to pack down my bike, and bring it up to my room.

I had an early night, as I was starting to brew on a cold.

### Day 3, 96km, 616m - I think I've caught a cold

I woke up with a soar throat that morning, so I was definitely brewing on something.
Even though I was feeling my legs, and throat, the ride felt fast.
There wasn't much too experience on the road, so not many breaks.
The highlight of the day was probably the random World War 2 outdoor "museum", where a replica of a kamikaze plane and submarine was placed on a small gravel field.
The sign for 人間魚雷 回天１型レプリカ was really small, but I'm glad I turned around to check it out.
A rule of thumb is to generally stop if you curious on what something is, you rarely regret stopping, but I keep regretting not stopping.

I was supposed to take a ferry from an island I cycled out onto, but it turned out it didn't depart that often, so I had to bike back and onto a car road.
So the last 20km was tiresome as I was riding next to a busy road in the city of Tokushima.

I went out for a beer that evening, and found this really cool izakaya called Yaninju (沖縄居酒屋 やーにんじゅー), which is Okinawa themed.
It was only one other guest that night, and I quickly got chatting with him, and the bar owners.
The food and drinks was good, and they where playing Okinawa music!
One of the owners also took out his sanshin (三線) and started playing it!
It was a blast, and I really want to go back.

I was happy I had a rest day next day, as it got late.

### Day 4, Rest day with a cold

The weather for my first rest day wasn't great, it started with rain, then a couple of hours dry, before it started again.
I has also definitively cached a cold, so went out to buy some Japanese medicine.
Since I don't often take medicines, and it at caffeine in it (I don't drink coffee), it had a really good effect on me!

The goal for my rest day was to visit Awaodori Kaikan (阿波おどり会館), and learn more about the traditional Awa Dance Festival held every year in August.
It was a moving experience, since after the show, we where invited up on the stage to learn the dance our self.
I'm not the best dancer, but it was still fun!

After I had danced a bit I took the rope way up to Bizan Park (眉山公園) too get the gray view of the city (since it was still raining at this time).
I even got too see some more cherry blossom.

Then I visited Tokushima Castle Museum (徳島市立徳島城博物館), not the most interesting museum, but the park was small and beautiful.
Since the rain had stopped I took a walk around the park, and got too see even more cherry blossom.
You could tell that the cherry blossom season had started, as it was now everywhere!

### Day 5, 123km, 1101m - First missed road station

Had planned a long day after the rest day, and the weather was promising!
As always I was a little bit late starting todays ride, but luckily didn't turn in to a problem.
The first exciting thing today was all the turtle chilling in the small river I was cycling next to.
There where so many, and every time I rode past them they all jumped into the river and hid.
So it wasn't easy getting a good photo of them.
Shy creatures!

I talked to some locals later that day, and they said that turtles wasn't local to the area, and that they where probably put out and abandoned, which is quite sad.
I also later read that turtles (at least pond slider turtles) can be an invasive specie.

On a small detour to avoid the big road I saw a lonely ape sitting next to the road, scampering away when I got close.

As I hadn't marked the stamp locations on my Garmin map, I managed to cycle past todays checkpoint!
I didn't figured it out before I was 5km past it, so I had to turn around and cycle back.
The funny thing is that I remember the junction where I missed it, as I was paying extra attention to remember to take the correct right.
I also had a really good tail wind, so it was extra work getting back.

Back on the track it was mostly just road and forest all the way to Shishikui.
On the way I had lunch at a café that looked like a ruined!
It's called Dai Bosatsu Tōgé (大菩薩峠) and the food was really good too!

I arrived a bit late at the Pension Shishikui (ペンションししくい), so I had to hurry to get some dinner before the last place in town closed for the day.
Afterwards I took a dip in the sea, as the pension was in this small bay, on the beach.
The water was (not surprisingly) cold, kind of like cold Norwegian summers.
Luckily they had a small warm bath I could escape too after my dip.
The view was amazing from the pension, and is really worth a stay.

That night I also found out that this town has a one of it's kind bus that goes on train tracks too!
So with a little bit of planning I could managed to try it out before breakfast tomorrow.
The plan was to bike to the train station, lock my bike there, walk ten minutes over to where the bus started.
Stay on the bus till it switched to train-mode and jump off at the train station where my bike was!

### Day 6, 87km, 400m - A day full of activities

I slept really bad this night, there was something constantly making a humming noise, and some small vibrations.
My guess is that it was from the kitchen below me.

Even though I slept badly I went for my plan for a bus/train ride before breakfast.
I got up at 6:45, which isn't really early, but I usually slept till 7:30, or 8:00.
I quickly dressed, and cycled over to the train station.
It was really quiet in the small town, and I didn't see many people when I walked from the train station over to the bus stop.
I had pre-booked tickets, I wasn't sure how popular the ride would be, and boy was I wrong, I was the only one on the whole 20 minute ride!
So the bus had a couple of bus stop before it drove on to the train tracks at Kannoura station (甲浦駅), "switched" wheels, and drove as a train back too Shishikui stations (宍喰駅).

It was a fun experience, but it felt like the worst of both worlds.
The ride wasn't really smooth, as it was a heavy bus, but a light train, it was also really noisy.
If you want to know more about this, you should check out Tom Scott's [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kn56bMZ9OE8) about it.

My first stop of the day (after breakfast) was a closed down children school that had been turned into an aquarium!
It was quite fun walking through the halls, and rooms of an old school.
Sadly, as all the other aquarium I've visited in Japan the tanks are small.
So the fish doesn't have any space to move, and can hardly turn around.
Luckily the water is clean, and there is a current in the water!
The extra special with this aquarium, since it was in a school, is that they had used the two swimming pools as two pretty big (but shallow) fish tanks!
Though there was no features in the pools, so nothing trying to make it look like a natural habitat.

After the aquarium I collected two more stamps for my pamphlet before I found a whale museum!
I've always though whales are an interesting specie, so it was interesting to learn more about the Japanese whaling culture.
The south of Shikoku, and especially around Muroto has an old history of whale hunting.
They sold small tea spoons formed as whales too!

Before rolling in to Aki, the city for the night, I stopped to visit [Ioki Cave (伊尾木洞)]https://www.akikanko.or.jp/kanko/iokidou.html).
The cave is a short cave opening up into a long and narrow hidden green valley!
You can either just pass through the cave, or you can follow the valley to it's end, and hike out of it.
As you are following a shallow river all the way to the end, so the ground is wet in most places.
So it could be wise to have some shoes that are a bit waterproof.
I managed to hike all the way without getting wet, but it required some balancing on some rocks here and there.

There is also two signs warning you about venomous snakes, and recommend rain boots.
I didn't see any snakes, but that didn1t stop me from being extra careful while walking, and stomping extra hard.
At the hotel later that night I asked my host if she have heard or seen any snakes there, but she hadn't either.
The cave and valley was really serene and beautiful, so wholly recommend.

My place for the night was one of the places I had to book through e-mail, and I'm really happy that I did!
The hostel is Kochi-no-ya (Hostel 東風ノ家-古民家宿&Cafebar-), it's really small, and the owner was really nice.
She even had a small bar each evening for the guests and locals, so a great place to sit and chat.

### Day 7, 91km, 574m - Botanical garden, and my first rain day

I had in advance decided to not visit Kōchi on this trip, I felt I didn't have the extra day to properly see the city, so maybe next time.
What I did want to see was the botanical garden on the out skirt of the city.

Kōchi Prefectural Makino Botanical Garden was on top of a hill, luckily it had a one way street up and down, so not that many cars passing me while I steadily worked my self up.
The bike parking was also surprisingly far away from the entrance, but at least there was toilets there, so I could change from my cycling outfit, to some regular clothes.
The garden was really nice, with a beautiful view over Kōchi city, and endless variations of trees and bushes.
They even had a green house with some huge Monsteras plants!
The garden is named after Dr. Tomitaro Makino, the father of Japanese botany!

I had planned to eat lunch at the harden, but I had chosen to take the scenic route to the garden, which hadn't any konbinis to stop for some snacks.
So I had gotten really hungry at the end of my garden visit, and with the long queue for the only restaurant at the botanical garden I decided to bounce.
There was a a brewery down at the coast, not that much off track, so I decided to eat there instead.

The South Horizon Brewery was located on a small hill inside an industrial area, so it wasn't straight forward navigating to it, but after stopping several time to look at Google Maps I managed to find it!
It stood for it self, with a direct view of the endless Pacific ocean.
The brewery looked to be a pretty cool and trendy place, with several interesting beers on tap, even though the food wasn't great, at least for a vegetarian,
I also ended up buying one can of a dark stout, to enjoy a later evening.

Until now I had been lucky to not have been cycling in the rain, but you can't have it be sunny and warm every day.
Even though the sun hadn't been that much out on my trip, it had been mostly overcast.
So the last two hours to Susaki (須崎市) I was cycling in rain.
As it hadn't been watching the forecast I had packed most of my rain gear way down in my bags, so I only had access to my rain jacket.
So I ended up with some wet shoes.
Luckily I was able to borrow a hair dryer at the ryokan I stayed at to dry out my shoes.
It worked pretty good, and there was only a hint of wetness the next day.

### Day 8, 81km, 677m - The start of Shimanto river

When I woke up the next day my shoes where nearly dried out!
Todays ride would be mostly flat, except for one big hill that would have me up 250 meters in one go.
From there it would be just down hill following the Shimanto river.
The weather was gray, but luckily no rain!

When I plan a bike trip I do a lot of research to avoid tunnels, especially if they don't have a foot path.
This day was no exception, so I had planned for a pretty nice ride following the coast, instead of going through the mountain.
Turns out the road was closed when I arrived at the start of it, not far from the tunnel.
It didn't say why it was closed, and I've experienced closed roads before in Japan that where only closed for cars, and since no one was there to stop me, I went for it!
My gamble was worth it!
It turned out there had been a landslide over the road, but most of it was cleaned up now, and it was not a problem to pass through.
I had cycled worse roads that where open in Japan before.

It didn't see many other bikepackers on my trip around Shikoku, so when I saw someone I always made sure to wave, or stop for a short chat.
While cycling through a town called Niida I passed two people on folding bikes, a popular bike for traveling in Japan.
As I stopped by a patisserie shortly after, I saw them again when I sat eating a cake outside the store.
It wasn't long after that I saw them for a third time, when I stopped at the next road station to get my stamp, but this time we where all off our bike, so we had time for a chat.
They where from Singapore, and it turned out they where also cycling around Shikoku, just using twice the time I had.
They where also heading to the same guesthouse as I was, just that they was planning to be there the next night.
So maybe I would meet them again!

Later in the day I cycled by the [Kaiyodo Hobby Museum (海洋堂ホビー館四万十)](http://ksmv.jp/hobbykan/).
It was a medium sized museum with a lot of figures to look at.
I only recognized a few of the figures, but it was fun.
As other museum I had visited on the trip, there wasn't many other people there.

After the museum I had a visit to another stamp location before arriving at my final stop for the day, Tosa-Taishō (土佐大正).
Next to the stamp location was a small park with a park with a windmill made out of stone, they had translated it to Stone a mill, which is a bit funny.

Finally I reached my stay for the night, the [Guesthouse Samaru (ゲストハウス)](https://samaru.jp/).
The owner was a friendly and quite guy in his mid forties.
I was the only guest in the mixed bed room, so I had the whole place for my self.
For dinner I went to the only open izakaya in the town, and as usually I ended up ordering too much food.
I needed to get better at order one and one dish, instead of all at once!

### Day 9 - A rainy rest day in Tosa-Taishō

My original plan was to cycle for another day and have my rest day in Nakamura, but with the current forecast with a lot of rain, I decided to cancel my next hotel and have my rest day in Tosa-Taishō.
It also helped that the following day was looking to be a sunny day.

So with a hole day to kill in a small town I was finished sightseeing in just about an hour.
I started visiting an 800 year old cedar tree, before I looked at the exterior of an old farm house that was relocated to the town.
As it was closed today I wasn't able to look inside it.
After wards I continued to visit the local sake and shochu brewery, and since I there was a language barrier the woman in the store thought I was interested to see the brewery too.
So I got a short tour around the brewery, where I could look down into the barrels, smell the chestnuts they used to brew.
After the tour we went back to the store and I got to taste three different sakes, and two shochus.
A bit early for that much alcohol, but they where good.

Before heading back to the guest house I had a look at the train station, and I was lucky with the timing.
Just before I got the station both the local trains had arrived at the station, and it seemed to be a short break.
So I was able to take a closer look at the two trains.
One of them looked like a small bullet train, or Shinkansen as it's called in Japanese.

When I got back to the guest house my cycling friends from yesterday had arrived, and was checking in.
They had battled through the rain, and was ready to have an easy after noon.

In the evening we all sat down in the living room, had a beer, relaxed and chatted.
Turns out the owner was a big fan of an old Japanese TV-show that had visited Norway, way back in the 90's.
So he put it on for us to watch.
It was fun to watch how Oslo had changed over the years!

While chatting I also learned that the small town had made collectible cards, that you could buy in the different stores throughout the town.
Some of them where pretty nice, so I went out to buy four of them, to support the small town.


### Day 10, 76km, 484m - Lazy river cruising

This was the first day with proper sun since I finished the [Shimanami Kaido](2024-03-29-shimanami-kaido.md).
The original plan was to follow the main road close to the river all the way down to Nakamura, but with the good weather I decided to try out some of the many side roads.
That also helped me avoid most of the cars.

On the first road station for the day I was able to ride on a zip-line.
I was the only one there, and I had to watch a five minute safety course in Japanese first.
Then I was driven around to the other side of the river.
It was a short zip-line, but glad I took the time off for it.

Until the first road station I followed the couple from Singapore, but from there on I went in my own pace.

On one of the side roads there where some road work, and as always there is one guy navigating the traffic.
He was busy talking with the other workers, probably because the road was a bit remote, so he didn't notice me rolling up the work site.
Bikes are quite noiseless, so I got quite surprised when his coworker pointed at me, he tried to blow his whistle to let the digger to stop, but I dropped it before I finally manage to blow it.
It was quite funny to watch him fiddling when he saw me.

For about a year I have followed the Youtube channel [maigomika](https://www.youtube.com/@maigomika), which is about a Canadian couple living in a Japanese “akiya” house.
I was hoping to meet them, but since I didn't really know where they lived, other than rural Shikoku, the chances was pretty low.
My guess was that they lived next to Shimanto, but that was just a gut feeling, since they often bathed in a big river.
It turns out my gut feeling was right!
On one of the side roads I saw a couple with a dog coming towards me, and lo and behold, it was Mika, Jesse, and Pancake on a sunny walk.
I stopped and chatted to them for a bit, they where as lovely in real life as they where on Youtube.
I totally forgot to get a selfie with them, but maybe next time.

Before checking in at my hotel I visited a dragonfly park (四万十市トンボ自然公園).
I didn't see any dragonflies, but several turtles, which are more exotic for me!
The whole place was a big wet land reservation, and you could walk around most of the area.

### Day 11, 82km, 937m - Strong winds around the cape

Today I was back cycling next to the coast, the wind was strong, but luckily not much head wind.
I took a bigger detour to avoid a long tunnel, which was really nice.
The view was great close to the sea.

The trip felt long, especially around Cape Ashizuri.
The cape it self had a nice view, but nothing specially.

Once in Misakiura I visited a sea shell gallery, with way too many sea shells.
The building itself was also pretty cool, kinda like a boat from the side, but open, and letting in sun from the inside.
After wards I visited a pretty cool underwater aquarium, where you could look out at the sea bed, and all the fish swimming around.
As I was late in the day, and long after feeding it wasn't full of fish, but I saw enough.
turns out there are five more of these underwater aquarium, so I want to visit them all now!

For the night I stayed at an old ryokan by the name Orange hotel.
I got a family room, furthest away from the entrance, and it turned out to include dinner, and breakfast.
It was showing good signs of age, but the staff was friendly, and they had non-smoking room which is important for me.

### Day 12, 61km, 756m - Slow day, with a nice hill at the end

Day 12 was a quite ride following the coast for most of the day.
The original plan was to avoid all of the tunnels on the route, but my legs was getting heavy, so I avoided the longer detour I had planned.
Luckily the traffic was slow, so the tunnels went smooth.
The weather was nice, but some wind, similar to the previous days.

On the way I passed a slide made with rolls, I've never seen that before, so I had to try it!
It didn't look much used, and the area around was growing back.
The roller slide was surprisingly fast, so I had to break with my feet to avoid getting to much speed.
It was quite long too, and had a cool spiral at the end.
The rolls wasn't the best for my butt, even though I had padding from the cycling shorts.

Arriving in Mishohirajo I first visited the road station to get my stamp.
There I saw some interesting lemon umeshu that I hadn't seen before.
As I didn't want to cycle the rest of the trip with a bottle of umeshu, and it was too big to drink in one night, I choose to not buy it.
That was till I saw a Yamato office just around the corner!
Yamato is a shipping company, mostly door-to-door.
This meant I could use them to ship my bottle till my hotel in Hiroshima.
So I went back, picked up two bottles, and rode to the shipping office.
It was no problem shipping the bottles, and they even packed the package for me!
So great service.

After wards I rode to my Yamashiroya Ryokan (山代屋旅館) to take a bath, before I head out to find somewhere to eat.

While wandering around I found this small restaurant called Bar SAKEおざき.
It was a small place with only two tables, and one of the tables was full when I arrived.
The owner and chef didn't really speak English, but it turns out that one of the guest was an English teacher that saw this as a possibility to practice his English!
So the teacher took charge and got me set up for the night!
I ended up with two servings, first a wonderful homemade cheese pizza, and then a tasty spaghetti dish.
For dessert I got a big glass of sake, way too much for me.
I had a unforgettable evening, with great food, wine, and sake, plus I got to meet some locals!

When I got back to the ryokan that evening it was locked!
I tried to knock on the door, walk around the building to see if there was an extra entrance, but to no avail.
Luckily there was a izakaya still open just around the corner that I got some help from.
After a little bit of miming they finally understood I was locked out, and they called the owner.
He was luckily not asleep, so I got in after just a couple of minutes, and could finally go to bed.

### Day 13, 58km, 897m - Re-planning and re-routing

I had originally planned to do some hiking after my cycle trip around Shikoku.
The plan was to ride back to Imabari, and then hike Mount Ishizuchi (石鎚山), the tallest mountain in Shikoku, using the ropeway.
Sadly I found out that the ropeway was closed for maintenance the days I would hike, meaning that I had to chose between either hiking the hole mountain, or save it for later.
With the shifting forecast, and my tired legs I opted for the later, saving it for later.

This meant that I had two extra days to spend.
I ended up splitting the next days distance in to two short distances, with some added hills for fun.

So today was a short, but hilly day.
The original course was to follow the main road around the mountain, but instead I took the direct route over the mountain pass.

It was a perfect day for climbing the 580 meters to the top.
The sun was shining, no wind in the mountains, and I think I met only two cars on the way up!
On the top they where hard at work building huge windmill, I have no idea how they manage to get the wings up with all those trees and switch backs.
There was also a white guy working at the top, saw him to late to ask what he was also doing at such a remote place.

The decent was also really nice, where I could coast most of the way back to sea level!

I arrived before check-in at Dear U (うわじまゲストハウス&カフェ) hostel in Uwajima.
Giving me ample time to see the local castle.
It was a small one, as only the three story keep remains, built at the end of 1500!
The castle was on a top of a steep hill, giving me a great view of the city.

For dinner I eat some great cheese nan, which is often one of my highlights when I visit Japan.
At the hostel I met a woman from Tazmania, and a guy from Shanghai!

### Day 14, 54km, 735m - The mammoth family of straw

It was getting harder to get out of bed, my legs are tired, and I'm not sleeping that well.
Bad sleep has been ha recurring theme for this trip.
Not sure why, but there has been some hard beds, and I'm a side sleeper.

It was another short route today, to the city of Yawatahama.
The weather was still pretty nice, and with the shorter route I could avoid a 1100m tunnel!

The day started with getting out of the city and heading into the hills.
When I look back at the Google Street View I have very few recollection of the first small hill of the day, even though it looks wonderful to ride.
I do remember the big empty park before the hill, and the Lawson after the hill.

The next challenge of the day took me up to the Hoketu Mountain pass Observation Deck (法華津峠展望台), which felt like an abandoned tourist spot.
There had been a toilet, and something that looked like a bar here, but that had been ages ago.
I could practice my kanji on the big sign spelling out: Ho 法 Ke 華 Tsu 津 Toge 峠.

After cruising down the hill, and getting my stamp at Road side rest area Donburi Hall (道の駅 どんぶり館), I cycled over to the Ehime Prefecture Museum of History and Culture (愛媛県歴史文化博物館).
This was a pretty big museum telling the story Ehime, where you could walk inside old building, trams, and look at how Ehime had evolved over time.
Really interesting, they even had a section for the festival held through out the year!

Last stop for the day was a family of mammoth made out of straw!
To remember them I had been extra careful to mark them on my GCP, so when I was at the mark and still saw them I was quite surprised and disappointed.
There was a Lawson at my mark so I went in and grabbed some snacks, and thought that I should at least continue a little bit further since I had already gone so far out.
And I'm really glad I did!
Turns out my mark was wrong, and they where just hidden behind some houses from where I stopped!
They where exactly what they sound like, and it was a fun experience.
The family consisted of three mammoth, father, mother, and a baby.
There where several families visiting at the same time as me, so I'm guessing it's quite known place.

On the last stretch to Yawatahama I spotted a mystical tree tunnel (市営王子の森公園 木のトンネル) next to a park.
It was like taken out of a Studio Ghibli movie, and it was a bit magical walking through it!

There wasn't much too see or do in Yawatahama, but I had some great Sapporo style ramen!

### Day 15, 76km, 722m - To the island "capital", Matsuyama

When I got up this day I though it would be overcast, and a long, heavy day.
It turned out to be quite the opposite.

I had chosen to again avoid the tunnels, and go over the mountains, and it turned out that the mountain was a bit lower than I had anticipated.
Which was really nice.
It wasn't really that steep either, so it was quite pleasantly working my way up the hills, and looking at all the hill farms, with their cool mono rails going all over the place.
A lot of the mono rails have been taken back by the nature.
Finally at the top of the hill I even managed to find a better way down, taking me further towards Matsuyama, instead of going straight down to the main road.
It wasn't much used, as there was a lot of debris spread all over the road.

After finishing todays hill, it was 60km of nearly flat asphalt all the way to Matsuyama.

On my way I said hello to a couple from Canada doing the South to North trip, and it was both their first bikepacking trip!
Which was really cool.

Later in the day I cycled past Shimonada Station (下灘駅), a famous train station looking over the bay.
I was in the zone as I pasted, so I totally forgot about it, and when I remembered it I didn't feel like turning around, as the exit was a bit before the station.
It also looked as their where already a lot of people there taking pictures.

When I got closer to the city I found a more scenic route through the city following the river.
The original plan was to follow the main road, but I was a bit tired of cars.

It was a nice route, and there where plenty of people on picnics enjoying the sun, and the last piece of cherry blossoming.

### Day 16 70km, 405m - Last day to Imabari

My final day on my journey around Shikoku, and to collect as many stamps as I could!
The weather wasn't looking the best, it started with overcast, and was going to rain later in the day.

Yet again I managed to ride past my last stamp location, so again I had to backtrack about 5km.
Interestingly the same distance as last time.

My body was tired, but it was mostly flat, and not much of a wind.
I felt ready to finish my trip, but at the same time melancholy.
The trip had been a part of me for two weeks, and a big part of me wanted to just continue!

I had decided to not ride back to Matsuyama, and instead take the train.
So with the extra time I decided to check out a castle shaped observation deck (海山城跡 展望台).
It was of course on top of a steep hill, so I had to dig a bit deep to get up.
The view wasn't as promised as the trees had grown to big, and blocked the best view towards islands I had ridden two weeks earlier.

To finish my circle I rode back up to Kurushima Strait Observatory (来島海峡展望館), to where I started it all after riding Shimanami Kaido.
It was a bit strange being back at the same place as before, and it felt like I hadn't been here for a really long time, even though it was just two weeks ago.

Afterwards I visited the Imabari castle, before I bought some snacks and caught the local train back to Matsuyama.
I didn't understand, before after I was on the local train, that the train leaving 20 minutes later, would arrive half an hour earlier in Matsuyama.
It didn't matter much, I got to relax, look at the people taking the train, and eat my food.
Even though eating on the train is frowned upon.

## My gear

Similar to my last year trip I went for a lightweight setup.
The Shikoku setup was even lighter than Kyushu, as I didn't need a sleeping bag or tent.
This time I had a new seat post bag with a frame(!), and a new handle bar bag (called rando bag).
Both of them hand made in Ukraine by the wonderful people of [7rbags.com](https://7rbags.com/).

I also had mounted a set of aero bars, to give me more comfort for the long days, and some different ride positions.
Really happy with the aero bars!

On the areo bars I had mounted my (insurance company mandatory) simple bike lock, for easy non-disturbing access.
